# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control saves back-ups of your code at various points that you can access later.  This allows you to experiment with new features and improvements to the code, then have the option to revert to previous versions if something doesn't work as expected.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a separate version of the code that is frequently used to make changes and implement new features.  To keep the master code clean and working, coders work on branches until a new feature is ready to be merged into the master version,at which point they would submit a pull request and a teammate or manager would review/confirm.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is when you save changes that you've made, essentially creating a save point in the code and creating a record of who made changes.  A good commit message is concise and detailed, giving you a good description of the changes made in the commit.  This will be important in reviewing and troubleshooting.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs two branches are merged together and there are differences in the files.  GIT will ask you to review the differences and choose which one to include in the final version.
